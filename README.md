# About me
Hi, I’m Saahir 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at Dalhousie University. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies to learn and experiment with. I'm still figuring out how I want to specialize, but I'm really interested in web development and general software development right now.

## Tools
Some programming langauges I'm mildly comfortable with:
- ☕ Java
- 🐍 Python
- 🌐 Javascript
- ⏰ C
